Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling Using Diabetes Dataset

Conducted data analysis and predictive modeling using the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess relationships between key features such as age, sex, BMI, and blood pressure, and the target variable.
Built and evaluated a linear regression model to predict diabetes progression based on multiple patient features, achieving insights into the impact of various factors on health outcomes.
Utilized Python libraries pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning model implementation.
